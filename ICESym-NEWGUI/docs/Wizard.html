<h3> Wizard </h3>

<p> When you open ICESym-GUI, you must choose between two options:

<ul>
    <p><li><b>Open Case: </b>Open an existing case by clicking in the button with the folder icon.</li></p>
    <p><li><b>Start a New Case: </b>Create a New Blank Case or choose to start it with the wizard. You must provide a name for the new case.</li></p>
</ul>

<h4>Wizard</h4>

<p>The wizard allows you to start a case with a default structure, only inserting a few parameters as inputs. If you select to use the 
default type of Cylinder, the new case will be totally functional (this means that you will be able to run a correct simulation without changing
any other parameter). You have also the option to select the parameters to create a cylinder with different attributes.</p>
