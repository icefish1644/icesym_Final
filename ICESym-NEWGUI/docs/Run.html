<h3>Run Simulations</h3>

Once the simulation is configurated and the model is complete, you are ready to simulate. This can be done pushing the button <b>Run Simulation</b> in the
Run Tab. This will automatically execute the ICESym-1D code with the current model. You can watch the simulation progress in the log. This log is
stored in an archive called Run.log located in the simulator folder. At any time, you can stop the simulation by pushing the <b>Kill Process</b> button.

<h4>Run simulations outside the GUI</h4>
<p>The cases created in ICESym-GUI also can be executed on the console. To do that, you must use the exec binary inside the simulator folder:</p>
<code>$ ./exec CASE_PATH CASE_NAME</code>
<p>where CASE_NAME is the name of the .py file (without the .py extension) and CASE_PATH the path where the file is located.</p>
