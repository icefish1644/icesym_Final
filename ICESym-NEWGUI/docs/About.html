<h2>ICESym-GUI Help</h2>
<p><b>ICESym (Internal Combustion Engine Simulator) </b> is a simulation software made of two independents components.
The first component is the numerical solver called ICESym-1D, written in three languages (Cython, C++
and Fortran) that work together (see ICESym-1D Programmers Guide). The second component is a Graphical
User Interface called ICESym-GUI, that allows the user to configure, model, run and post-process simulations in an easy way.
</p>
<p>
ICESym-GUI is written in Python and it uses a graphics library called PyQt5, that is a binding of the Qt5
C++ class library with the Python programming language. The interface is divided into four parts: 

<ul>
<p><li>The Pre Process or Configuration Tab.</li></p>
<p><li>The Modeling Tab, that allows you to create, edit and manipulate components in the engine diagrams and setting the object's attributes in an easy way.</li></p>
<p><li>The Run Tab, with a log to see the progress of the simulation while running.</li></p>
<p><li>The Post Process Tab, to see and analyze the results.</li></p>
</ul>
