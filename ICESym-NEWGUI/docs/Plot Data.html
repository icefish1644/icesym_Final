<h3> Plot Data in Modeling </h3>
ICESym-GUI allows you to see a XY Plot for some attributes that have two columns. This attributes have a specific button that allows you to see a graphic with the current data. 

<p>For example, <b>Valve -> Discharge Coefficient</b> allows you to see its data. This is important because you can identify quickly the law that you used, and you don't need 
export data to or from other software.</p>
