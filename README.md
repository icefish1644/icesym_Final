# ICESym MPL

## Introduction 

This repo contains work that expands on the existing work completed by the original ICESym authors found [here](https://github.com/jmarcelogimenez/icesym). The goal of this project is to rely on the simulation results generated by ICESYM to generate charts that can be visualised using matplotlib.

## Usage

Attempting to visualise an engine model involves two key steps:

1. Run simulation
1. Visualise simulation

Instructions on how to complete these steps are detailed below.

### Run Simulation

#### Requirements

This step has been tested to work with the following components:

1. Ubuntu 20.04
1. 

#### Steps

1. Install essentials
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python2.7 python2.7-dev python-numpy gfortran build-essential     cython
    ```
1. Compile
    ```bash
    cd icesym/ICESym-1D/src
    ```
    ```bash
    rm sinCythonCPP.cpp
    ```
    ```bash
    sudo make install -B
    ```
1. Execute
    ```bash
    python2.7 exec.py
    ```

### Visualise output

#### Requirements

This step has been tested to work with the following components:
1. python3.8
1. matplotlib
1. numpy
1. Visual Studio Code

#### Steps

1. At the root of the project, in Visual Studio Code, right-click `main.py` then click on `Run Current File in Interactive Window`.
1. Observe matplotlib output
